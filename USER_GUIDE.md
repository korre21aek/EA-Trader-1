- Normalizes all features for neural network input
- Analyzes multiple timeframes simultaneously

### 2. Pattern Recognition
- Compares current market conditions with historical patterns
- Calculates similarity scores with past trades
- Adjusts confidence based on historical outcomes

### 3. Neural Network Analysis
- Processes normalized features through neural network
- Generates prediction with confidence score
- Applies activation functions (ReLU, Tanh)

### 4. Signal Generation
- Combines technical analysis signals
- Weights signals based on indicator strength
- Requires both neural network and technical confirmation

### 5. Trade Execution
- Only executes when confidence exceeds threshold
- Calculates position size based on risk and confidence
- Sets stop loss and take profit based on ATR

### 6. Position Management
- Implements trailing stop when in profit
- Monitors all positions continuously
- Closes positions based on AI signals or risk limits

### 7. Adaptive Learning

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Higher is better (> 1.0)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Should be < 20%
- **Total Trades**: Sufficient sample size (> 100 trades)

## Live Trading

### Before Going Live

1. **Backtest Thoroughly**: Test on at least 6 months of historical data
2. **Demo Test**: Run on demo account for at least 2 weeks
3. **Start Small**: Begin with minimum risk settings
4. **Monitor Closely**: Watch the first 10-20 trades carefully

### Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**:
   ```
   RiskPercent = 0.5%
   ConfidenceThreshold = 0.75
   MaxOpenTrades = 2
   MaxDailyDrawdown = 3%
   ```

2. **Monitor Daily**:
   - Check open positions
   - Review daily profit/loss
   - Watch for unusual behavior
   - Check EA logs for errors

3. **Gradual Scaling**:
   - After 50 successful trades, consider increasing risk to 1%
   - After 100 successful trades, consider adding more pairs
   - Always maintain strict risk management

4. **Regular Optimization**:
   - Re-optimize parameters quarterly
   - Adapt to changing market conditions
   - Keep MemorySize updated with recent patterns

### VPS Recommendations

For 24/7 trading:
- Use a low-latency VPS near your broker's server
- Minimum 2GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
- Windows Server with MT5 installed
- Automatic backup of EA settings

## Troubleshooting

### EA Not Opening Trades

**Possible Causes**:
1. Confidence threshold too high → Lower ConfidenceThreshold
2. No clear signals → Wait for better market conditions
3. Max trades limit reached → Increase MaxOpenTrades or close existing positions
4. Daily drawdown limit hit → Wait for next day or adjust MaxDailyDrawdown
5. Auto trading disabled → Enable Auto Trading button in MT5

### High Drawdown

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce RiskPercent (to 0.5% or lower)
2. Increase ConfidenceThreshold (to 0.75 or higher)
3. Reduce MaxOpenTrades
4. Enable trailing stop
5. Tighten StopLossATRMultiplier

### Too Many Losing Trades

**Solutions**:
1. Increase ConfidenceThreshold
2. Enable/check all technical indicators
3. Verify multi-timeframe analysis is enabled
4. Check if UseAdaptiveLearning is enabled
5. Increase TrainingPeriod for more data
6. Re-optimize parameters for current market

### Orders Rejected

**Possible Causes**:
1. Insufficient margin → Reduce lot size or RiskPercent
2. Invalid stops → Check StopLossATRMultiplier value
3. Market closed → Check trading hours
4. Connection issues → Check internet and MT5 connection
5. Broker restrictions → Verify EA trading is allowed

## Performance Optimization

### For Better Accuracy
- Increase NeuralLayers to 4-5
- Increase NeuronsPerLayer to 15-20
- Increase MemorySize to 1000
- Enable all AI features
- Use longer TrainingPeriod (150-200 bars)

### For Faster Execution
- Reduce NeuralLayers to 2
- Reduce NeuronsPerLayer to 8
- Reduce MemorySize to 300
- Disable SentimentAnalysis if not needed
- Use single timeframe analysis

### For Different Markets

**Scalping (M1-M5)**:
```
TimeFrame1 = M1
TimeFrame2 = M5
