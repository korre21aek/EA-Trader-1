   - High confidence threshold (0.75)
   - Best for beginners

2. **Aggressive Crypto Trader**
   - Higher risk (2.0%)
   - Lower confidence threshold (0.60)
   - Optimized for crypto volatility

3. **Balanced Multi-Market**
   - Moderate risk (1.0%)
   - Medium confidence (0.65)
   - Works on both Forex and Crypto

4. **Scalping Strategy**
   - Quick trades on M1-M5
   - Adjusted indicators for fast signals
   - High frequency trading

5. **Swing Trading Strategy**
